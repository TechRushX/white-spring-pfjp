#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Sordland.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The <span style="color: #3F7BC1;">PFJP</span> cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. With the increasing pluralism in Sordland, coalition building is more common both at the local and national level. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @independents: Strengthen our bonds with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">bludish</span> independent MPs.
- @wpb: Strengthen our bonds with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">Workers' Party of Bludia</span>.
- @cps: Work towards repairing relationships with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Communist Party</span>.
- @pfjp_alone: The <span style="color: #3F7BC1;">PFJP</span> can stand alone for now.

@cps_1
on-arrival: cps_relation += 5*(1 - dissent); cps_hostility -= 1

Relations between us and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">communists</span> are tense, ever since the shift of our party to the right and the subsequent departure of Stahler. However, we can still take efforts to reduce the level of hostility between us.

@cps_2
on-arrival: cps_relation += 10*(1 - dissent); cps_hostility -= 1

As the level of hostility between us and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">communists</span> has significantly reduced, this has made improvement of relations much easier.

go-to: ind_cooperative if sebastian_pfjp_leader == 0; ind_hostile if sebastian_pfjp_leader == 1; ind_friendly if manoly_pfjp_leader == 1

@ind_cooperative
on-arrival: ind_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

Due to our commitment to <span style="color: #D3C24D;">bludish</span> rights, the independents are more inclined to cooperate with us. However, our capitalist platform is slowing down our efforts.

@ind_hostile
on-arrival: ind_relation += 2*(1 - dissent)

The electing of Harringston has turned the independents against us, who are wary of our lack of support for equal rights of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">bludish</span> people. This is making fostering of good will almost impossible. 

@ind_friendly
on-arrival: ind_relation += 8*(1 - dissent); ind_hostility -= 1

Manoly's views are aligned closely with those of the independents, so relation building is more efficient.

go-to: wpb_cooperative if sebastian_pfjp_leader == 0 and wpb_hostility <= 0; wpb_unfriendly if wpb_hostility > 0; wpb_hostile if sebastian_pfjp_leader == 1

@wpb_cooperative
on-arrival: wpb_relation += 8*(1 - dissent); wpb_hostility -= 1

We have succesfully reduced the tensions between our parties. Improving relations comes much more easily than before. 

@wpb_unfriendly
on-arrival: wpb_relation += 5*(1 - dissent); wpb_hostility -= 1

The low level of trust between us and the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">WPB</span> makes building friendly relations difficult, but not impossible.

@wpb_hostile
on-arrival: wpb_relation += 2*(1 - dissent)

Sebastian has shown a rather opposing stance to advancing <span style="color: #D3C24D;">Bludish</span> rights, making any sort of cooperation between us and the WPB implausible.

@pfjp_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
